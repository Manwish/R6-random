"# R6-random" 
I made it for having fun time with friends, because I couldn't find any version of randomizer with all the operators. I wouldn't mind to get any suggestions though.
Maybe in the future I add other games, such as Dead By Daylight, Apex Legends, etc. 
I'm kinda lazy idiot, but still...
